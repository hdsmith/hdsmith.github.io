# H. D. Smith Pattern Library

The importance of this UI/UX guide is to create a baseline for consistency and fluency across all H. D. Smith web applications. This document should provide a basis and serve as a reference for designing, developing and styling new and existing H. D. Smith web applications for mobile and PC.

Our overall goal is to create user-friendly, intuitive interfaces for external as well as internal customers that provide the best customer experience possible and maximize usefulness, productivity and conversion.
